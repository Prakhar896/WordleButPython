HOW IT WORKS:

| INTRO |

This game is inspired by the Wordle game currently run by NY Times as of writing.

This game is very small and simple and is written in Python, a programming language, in a singular main.py file.

| GAME RULES |

You get 6 tries to guess a five-lettered word in the English Dictionary. The word can be any valid word.

Letters in your guess that are (a) in the actual word and (b) in the right position within the word,
are signified by a green box (ðŸŸ©) below the letter.

Letters in your guess that are (a) in the actual word but (b) not in the right position within the word,
are signified by a blue box (ðŸŸ¦) below the letter.

Letters in your guess that are not within the word at all are signified by a red box (ðŸŸ¥) below the letter.

| CONCLUSION |

That's it! This game written made by Prakhar Trivedi in 2022. You can check it out at the GitHub Repository:

            https://github.com/Prakhar896/WordleButPython

Thank you for downloading this game, and good luck, because you will need it. ;)
